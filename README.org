  + Sync can be performed on pairs of arrays. This leads 
    to that a number of threads equal to the GCD of the lengths of
    the arrays is used to compute and store them. 
  

* Work in progress
  + OpenCL generation is unfinished
  + CUDA generation is "untested" 
  + More library functions needed
